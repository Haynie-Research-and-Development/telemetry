# Telemetry Reporting System
The Telemetry Reporting System ("TRS") is an in development system using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) micro controllers and [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) for RF communication at 433mhz; which is in the [ISM band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band) and is license free. This will enable long-range telemetry data transmissions without the use of [APRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) which requires an FCC (in the US) Amateur Radio License.
